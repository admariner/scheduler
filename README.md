# Scheduler Block
This block allows users to select one or more records in a grid view, and then displays all of the related "schedule" records on a calendar interface. Users are then able to click and drag dates on the calendar to select a start and end time, but only if that day/time slot is unoccupied by an existing record. Once dates are selected, a new scheduled record is added to the calendar and is opened in Airtable's expanded record modal to allow users to quickly fill in the remaining fields.
